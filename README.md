Now for a search example I will search for Austin,TX and the page will display the current weather. It will show if its cloudy, sunny, thunderstorms etc. 
It will also display the current date, the temperature, humidity, wind speed and a UV index which will display one of 3 colors (red, yellow, green) based on how high or how low it is. (Texas folks use sun screen!) In addition to that, it will also display the next 5 days of the forecast.
